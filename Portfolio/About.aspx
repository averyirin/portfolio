       <h3> Co-Founder of Vanguard Technologies</h3>  
        <p>At my co-founded company Vanguard Sensors, we harness inexpensive wireless
technology to bring new meaning to be connected. Being the lead programmer, I have worked
with our team to develop our Wi-Fi integrated Inventory Control System that won the
Entrepreneurial Award at the Georgian College Innovation Showcase 2015. This year, our team
and I look forward to bringing a truly built from scratch Laser Projection System usable for
advertising at Georgian College’s local events. I am very keen on bringing this innovation to
your company.</p>
